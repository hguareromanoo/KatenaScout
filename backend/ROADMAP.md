# KatenaScout Project Roadmap

## Project Status

The KatenaScout backend has been successfully refactored into a modular, maintainable architecture. The codebase now follows a clean separation of concerns with the following structure:

- **core/** - Core business logic for session management, intent recognition, and player search
- **models/** - Data models for parameters, players, and API responses
- **services/** - Service wrappers for external APIs and data access
- **utils/** - Utilities for formatting and validation
- **app.py** - Main Flask application and route definitions

The player comparison functionality has been improved and integrated with the search system, allowing for a more streamlined user experience.

## Next Steps and Improvements
