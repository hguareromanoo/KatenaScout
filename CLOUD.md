### Frontend Implementation

1. **Multi-language UI**
   - Added language selector component in settings
   - Implemented translation objects for all UI elements across all components
   - Used dynamic text rendering based on selected language
   - Persisted language preference in localStorage
   - Language-specific position mapping for player positions

2. **Player Dashboard Modal**
   - Changed player dashboard from side-by-side to modal popup
   - Enhanced player profile with radar charts and statistics
   - Added favorite toggle in player profile
   - Implemented multi-language support for all dashboard elements
   - Added responsive design for better mobile experience

3. **Favorites Management**
   - Created dedicated FavoritesView component
   - Added player card display with images and key information
   - Implemented search functionality within favorites
   - Added ability to remove favorites directly from the list
   - Included multi-language support for the entire favorites section

4. **Settings Management**
   - Implemented SettingsView component
   - Added language selection with flags and native names
   - Included app information section
   - Dynamic fetching of language data from backend
   - Full multi-language support for settings UI

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Added sidebar navigation for easy access to all features
   - Separated satisfaction questions in different chat bubbles
   - Improved visual styling with consistent design language
   - Enhanced responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Added custom scrollbar styling for better usability

## Component Structure

1. **App Component**
   - Main component managing application state
   - Handles view switching and state management
   - Controls sidebar and navigation
   - Manages shared state like favorites and language

2. **ChatInterface Component**
   - Handles chat interactions with AI
   - Displays player search results
   - Connects to backend API
   - Provides player selection functionality

3. **PlayerDashboard Component**
   - Displays detailed player information
   - Shows radar charts for player statistics
   - Provides favorite toggle functionality
   - Multi-language support for all elements

4. **FavoritesView Component**
   - Displays list of favorite players
   - Allows searching within favorites
   - Provides remove functionality
   - Enables viewing detailed player information

5. **SettingsView Component**
   - Manages language preferences
   - Displays application information
   - Connects to language API
   - Persists settings in localStorage

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   - User inputs natural language query
   - Query is sent to backend with session ID and language preference
   - Backend processes query through Claude AI
   - Results are returned with player data and separate satisfaction question
   - Frontend displays results and handles user interaction

2. **Favorites Management**
   - User can toggle favorite status on player profiles
   - Favorites are stored in localStorage
   - Favorites page retrieves and displays saved players
   - Changes to favorites are immediately reflected across the application

3. **Language Selection**
   - User selects language from settings
   - Language preference is stored in localStorage
   - All subsequent requests include language parameter
   - UI updates to display text in selected language
   - Position names and UI elements are translated dynamically

## Implementation Details

- **localStorage Strategy**: All user preferences and favorites are stored in localStorage
  - chatSessionId: Stores current chat session ID
  - favorites: Stores array of favorite player objects
  - language: Stores user language preference
  - chatHistory: Stores array of recent chat sessions

- **Multi-language Implementation**:
  - All components include dedicated translation objects
  - Each supported language (English, Portuguese, Spanish, Bulgarian) has complete translations
  - Components dynamically select text based on current language setting
  - Backend API includes language-specific responses

- **Position Mapping**:
  - Position codes (e.g., 'cf', 'cb', 'lw') are mapped to readable names
  - Different mappings exist for each supported language
  - Custom mapping functions in relevant components

## Deployment Considerations

- Backend API should be running on localhost:5001
- No external authentication or database required
- Minimal dependencies for easy deployment
- Works with existing backend API without modifications

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts and cloud storage for favorites
- More advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Performance optimizations for larger datasets
- Additional language support
- Team composition recommendations
- Advanced statistical comparisons between players
